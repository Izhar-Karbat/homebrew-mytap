===================================================================

This is a Homebrew tap for installing MUSCLE, a popular multiple sequence alignment tool, on macOS.

About MUSCLE
------------

MUSCLE is a high-performance multiple sequence alignment program for protein and nucleotide sequences. It is widely used in bioinformatics and computational biology for tasks such as phylogenetic analysis, identification of conserved regions, and more.

Key features of MUSCLE include:

- High accuracy
- Fast performance, particularly for large datasets
- Support for a variety of input and output formats
- Ability to handle hundreds or thousands of sequences

For more information about MUSCLE, see the [official website](https://github.com/rcedgar/muscle) and the [scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=MUSCLE+multiple+sequence+alignment) describing the algorithm.
